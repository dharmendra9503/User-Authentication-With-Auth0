# Easy User Authentication for Express Web Apps

This repository hosts a Node project that defines a web app using Express. You'll secure access to some of its routes using Auth0 User Authentication.

## Get Started

Install the client project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open another terminal window and run the client proxy that enables live reload:

```
npm run ui
```

The application runs by on port `4040` to mitigate conflicting with other client applications you may be running.

Visit [`http://localhost:4040/`](http://localhost:4040/) to access the starter application.
